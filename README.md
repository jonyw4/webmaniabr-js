A JavaScript library to interface with Melhor Envio API, it works with Node.js. The [documentation can be found here](https://jonyw4.github.io/melhor-envio-js/).

## üåü Features
This library its in **early stages**, so it doesn't have interfaces for all MelhorEnvio features (Your PR is very welcome).

With this library you can:
- Get Shipment Services
- Calculate Shipment

## üìñ How to use?
Install the library
```bash
npm i menv-js
```

Import the library
```typescript
import MelhorEnvio from 'menv-js';

const menv = new MelhorEnvio(token, isSandbox, timeout);
const response = await menv.getShipmentServices();
```

## üìö API Docs

This library provides a promise based interface for all functions. Before you
can use the library, you need to provide authentication details which will be
used through API calls.

For a detailed documentation, see our [Documentation](https://jonyw4.github.io/melhor-envio-js/).
